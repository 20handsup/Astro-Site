We are writing to tell you that you, or the worker whose Social Security number appears at the top of this form, MAY be entitled to some retirement benefits from a private employer.  Also, your family, or the work's family, amy be entitled to retirement or survivor benefits.

## These Are Not Social Security Benefits

These potential benefits are NOT Social Security benefits.  We do not make any decisions about the payment of these benefits.  Please see below for basic information about these retirement benefits.

## Information About Retirement Benefits

You have, or the worker has, earned retirement benefits although no long employed in a job covered by the retirement plan.  These are called "deferred vested benefits."  Private retirement plan administrators must provide information about such benefits to us through the Internal Revenue service.  We provide this reported information about the retirement plan when the individual asks for it or when a claim is filed for Social Security benefits.  Social Security does not have any information about the benefits other than what appears below.

## If You Want to Apply for These Benefits

If you want to apply for these retirement benefits or have any questions, you should contact the Plan Administrator shown below.  The Plan Administrator provided the information as of the date in the "Year Reported" field below.  If you or the worker has already filed a claim and received payment from the plan below, you may not be eligible for any additional benefits.  Include a copy of this notice when you contact the plan Administrator.
